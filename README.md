# Complex-Number-Operators
Write functions to handle Complex Numbers.  Class Project.  

Project was written in three separate languages.  Java, Python, and C++ are the languages used.  Workflow started in Java, moved to C++ and then finished in Python.  This one is a little less commented on than my usual style.
